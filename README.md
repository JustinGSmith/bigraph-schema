# Bigraph-Schema

`bigraph-schema` provides a serializable type schema for compositional and multiscale modeling.  
It defines a compact, extensible language for describing hierarchical data structures — the foundation of the Vivarium 2.0 simulation framework.

The library offers a unified interface for representing, validating, and transforming schemas and data in structured simulations.  
By standardizing schema definitions, it enables interoperability between models, extensibility across frameworks, and reproducibility of computational experiments.
